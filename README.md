# AutoCoder
Autocoder is an automated code generation tool designed to speed up software development process by generating boilerplate code, templates and other repetitive structures based on issues and predifined patterns

README is usually a plain text file (if it's called README.md though, it's using markdown markup like the provided example) which serves as an introduction to a project explaining what it does and why. There is no strict content policy for a README file, which, to some extent, will also depend on whom you're writing it for (users or developers). However, you may notice some commonly-used sections like:

Name
Description
Installation
Usage
FAQ
Support
Contributing
Contact information
License
