<p></p><h5 id="description">Description</h5><p>Use GitHub Actions to interact with the GitHub API to read issues and comments. Accessing issues is made even simpler with the github.event variable in GitHub Actions. This environment variable provides payload information about the event that triggered the workflow. Use this variable to access issue details such as title, body, assignees, and labels and echo them back in the workflow logs. These environment variables include:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">Issue Number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
Issue Body: ${{ github.event.issue.body }}
Issue Assignees: ${{ join(github.event.issue.assignees.*.login, ', ') }}
Issue Labels: ${{ join(github.event.issue.labels.*.name, ', ') }}</code></pre><p>These variables can also be used when creating the URLs needed to interact with the GitHub API. For example, to retrieve the issues, you can use the following commands in your workflow:</p><pre><code class="language-yaml">ISSUE_NUMBER=${{ github.event.issue.number }}
ISSUE_RESPONSE=$(curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/${{ github.repository }}/issues/$ISSUE_NUMBER)
echo "Issue Information: $ISSUE_RESPONSE"</code></pre><h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5><p>To pass this stage, perform the following:</p><ul><li><p>Modify the workflow to trigger when a new issue opened and when a closed issue is reopened;</p></li><li><p>Checkout the repository using the appropriate action;</p></li><li><p>Set and use environment variables to read the content of the issue that triggered the workflow taking advantage of the github.event variable to access issue details such as number, title, body, assignees, and labels as shown in the example above;</p></li><li><p>Echo the content back in the workflow logs;</p></li></ul><h5 id="examples">Examples</h5><p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p><pre><code class="language-yaml">name: Access Issue Information
